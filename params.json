{"body":"### Some of my current projects\r\n\r\n### iKidApps\r\niKidApps is a app review site I acquired in the summer of 2012. It specializes in apps that tend to be more educational.  I will add a few games or utilities in there if they are stellar, but mostly it's about finding apps that make the iPad or iPhone a great learning tool for kids.   As any parent with an iPad knows, kids are drawn to them like moths to a flame.  So, let's use that interest for good, not evil. :)  \r\n[iPad apps for kids](http://iKidApps.com)\r\n\r\n### StarChart.Me\r\nStarChart is a project acquired in the winter of 2012.  It had long languished and had virtually no marketing done for it.   I hope to leverage iKidApps and the little online marketing that I have learned to boost it's popularity.  We always loved using reward charts for our kids.   We found that when used properly, they made us all happier.\r\n[Online Reward Charts for Kids](http://starchart.me)\r\n\r\n","name":"BSharpe","tagline":"A Page about my Projects","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
